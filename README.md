# hackathonCS

- Google Chrome extension for codesmith hackathon project.
- Brute force adaptation using jQuery and vanilla Javascript to access specific text Nodes and replace them with either emojis or different text. 
- Allows for refactoring to provide more customization in the future such as using options form to input user word choice to be replaced by element of choice (image, link, different text, etc.).

# implementation on Google Chrome

- Fork and clone repo into one folder
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Enable developer mode (top right switch)
- Click ``Load Unpacked`` and select folder containing all extension files
- Navigate to page of choice and test out extension!

# not final build, will be modified in the future to remove nsfw aspect

- refactor from brute force method to generate clean code with good time and space complexities
- goals will be to implement a different filter feature not requiring querying for nsfw words
- utilize data from an API not requiring a key or oAuth
- add option form to create more customization ability
